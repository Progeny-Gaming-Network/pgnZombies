## Most Common Questions Asked:

Q: Why not despawning the zombies after looting and zombies are getting despawned on killing?

A: This system has been made like that in order to spawn unlimited zombies without any issues. If i despawn the zombies after looting, it can cause many problems such as not spawning zombies (if those zombies got killed and not looted) and thats the reason why it is better to despawn them at the same time the zombies got killed.
